# Screeps

My scripts from the game Screeps

## What currently happens:

* Auto Spawn Harvester x 2
* Auto Spawn Upgrader x 2
* Auto Spawn Roady x 1
* Auto Spawn Builder x 4
* Manually build roads
* Manually put down extenders/containers
* Manually build walls
* Manually build turrets

## ToDo List:

* Have roadys also repair walls and other structures not just roads
* Have roadys repair only at less than 50% or similar and let tower handle otherwise.
* Check Harvesters also deposit to containers and extensions
* Have all workers top up from containers/extensions?
* Create build queue array so that taking energy from extensions doesn't interfer with spawning.
* Test Turret
* Wait until enemy spotted to make room safe or defenses down?
* redo roles based on "workers" which have priorities?
* Auto increase size of workers
